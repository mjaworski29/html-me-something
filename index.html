    <h1> Cake Monster Life </h1>
    <p> From February to October of 2014, I spent my time driving around the city of St. Louis and parts of Illinois to find all 256 plexiglass cakes placed at different historical locations to commemorate St. Louis' 250th birthday. </p>
    <p> This page will highlight the first as well as the last cakes on that journey along with a few in between that were of honorable mention. </p>

            <h2> The First Cake </h2>
            <p> The first cake I ever saw was on a random trip to the History Museum. Prior to this trip, I had heard about the cake project, but hadn't had much interest in it. However when we walked out of the History Museum and right into a cake, I was immediately hooked. </p>

            <h2> Mastodon State Park </h2>
            <p> One of my favorite cakes of the entire adventure was at Mastodon State Park which I likely would never have visited if it wasn't for this hunt. Not only did I get to see a crazy amazing looking cake, but also we were able to take some time to travel to the bone bed where actual Mastodon bones had been found. </p>

            <h2> Emma Kunz House </h2>
            <p> The Emma Kunz House in Illinois is special to me mainly because it was at this location that my mom took the picture of me with the cake that would end up being the masthead for my eventual cake blog. </p>

            <h2> The Nine Network </h2>
            <p> The cake at the Nine Network ended up being a milestone cake for me as after my year of cake hunting was complete, the Nine Network asked me to partiipate in an episode of one of their shows discussing the progress St. Louis made from 2014 to 2015. </p>

            <h2> The Final Cake </h2>
            <p> The final cake of the hunt was at the Daniel Boone House. For this cake, we met to see it and then traveled to a nearby winery to not only celebrate the end of the cake hunt but my birthday as well. </p>
